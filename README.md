# Hi, Nivashne here ðŸ‘‹

**Curious mind in the making â€” currently shaping my tech journey at Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College.**

Driven by a passion for **Artificial Intelligence**, **Generative AI**, **Neural Networks**, and **Data Science** â€“ not just as buzzwords, but as tools to solve real-world problems and build futuristic experiences.

 I enjoy training models, building smart systems, and experimenting with the creative edge of AI.
 Always eager to learn, collaborate, and innovate with fellow tech enthusiasts.
 I believe innovation thrives in collaboration, and I'm excited to team up to turn bold ideas into reality.
